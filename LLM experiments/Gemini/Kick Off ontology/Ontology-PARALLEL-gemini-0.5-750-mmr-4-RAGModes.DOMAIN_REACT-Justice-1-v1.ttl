:CriminalJusticeOntology a owl:Ontology ;
    rdfs:label "Criminal Justice Ontology" ;
    rdfs:comment "An ontology for assessing the risk of recidivism of released prisoners." .

# Knowledge Engineer (KE): Let's start by defining the core concepts. We need a class for Prisoner.

:Prisoner a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Prisoner" ;
    rdfs:comment "A person who has been incarcerated." .

# Domain Expert (DE):  We should also consider different statuses for prisoners, like "remand" and "sentenced".

:RemandPrisoner a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :Prisoner ;
    rdfs:label "Remand Prisoner" ;
    rdfs:comment "A prisoner held in custody awaiting trial." .

:SentencedPrisoner a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :Prisoner ;
    rdfs:label "Sentenced Prisoner" ;
    rdfs:comment "A prisoner serving a sentence after conviction." .


# Knowledge Worker (KW):  It's important to track the prisoner's release.  How about a class for "Release"?

:Release a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Release" ;
    rdfs:comment "An instance of a prisoner being released from prison." .

# KE: Good point. We'll need a property to link Prisoner and Release.

:hasRelease a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :Prisoner ;
    rdfs:range :Release ;
    rdfs:label "has release" .

# DE:  The data includes various release methods. We should include them.

:ReleaseMethod a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Release Method" .

:Parole a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :ReleaseMethod ;
    rdfs:label "Parole" .

:CompletionOfSentence a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :ReleaseMethod ;
    rdfs:label "Completion of Sentence" .

:Extradition a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :ReleaseMethod ;
    rdfs:label "Extradition" .

:releaseMethod a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :Release ;
    rdfs:range :ReleaseMethod ;
    rdfs:label "release method" .


# KW: The provided data mentions demographics, criminal history, and prison work. These are crucial for recidivism assessment.

# KE: Agreed. Let's add properties for these.

:hasAgeGroup a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :Prisoner ;
    rdfs:range :AgeGroup ;
    rdfs:label "has age group" .

:AgeGroup a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Age Group" .

# ... (Similarly define classes and properties for LevelOfEducation, MaritalStatus, Religion, Nationality, Occupation, Crime, etc.)

:hasCrime a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :Prisoner ;
    rdfs:range :Crime ;
    rdfs:label "has crime" .

:Crime a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Crime" .

:hasNumberOfReleases a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :Prisoner ;
    rdfs:range xsd:integer ;
    rdfs:label "number of releases" .

:daysInCustody a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :Prisoner ;
    rdfs:range xsd:integer ;
    rdfs:label "days in custody" .

:daysAfterRelease a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :Release ;
    rdfs:range xsd:integer ;
    rdfs:label "days after release" .

:penaltyDurationInDays a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :Prisoner ;
    rdfs:range xsd:integer ;
    rdfs:label "penalty duration in days" .

:workedInPrison a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :Prisoner ;
    rdfs:range xsd:boolean ;
    rdfs:label "worked in prison" .

# ... (Add more classes and properties based on the domain data and expertise, covering concepts like Court, Location, Penalty Type, etc.)

# DE: Don't forget about recidivism itself.

:Recidivism a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Recidivism" ;
    rdfs:comment "The act of reoffending after being released from prison." .

:hasRecidivismRisk a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :Prisoner ;
    rdfs:range xsd:string ;  # Or a more specific datatype if we have a risk scoring system
    rdfs:label "has recidivism risk" .


# KE: This looks like a good starting point. We can refine and extend it further based on specific competency questions and as we gather more information.

# KW: I agree.  This structure allows us to capture the essential data and begin analyzing it.  We can then identify gaps and add more detail as needed.
